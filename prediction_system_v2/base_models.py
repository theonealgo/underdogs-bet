"""
Base Models Module
==================

ML Layer with proper training:
- XGBoost: Gradient boosted trees, excellent for tabular data
- CatBoost: Handles categorical features natively, good regularization
- LightGBM: Fast training, good for large datasets
- Poisson/Dixon-Coles: Score-based model for low-scoring sports (NHL, MLB, soccer)

All models optimized for LOG LOSS and BRIER SCORE, not accuracy.
Uses proper time-series cross-validation (no data leakage).
