"""
Score Predictor using ESPN Team Stats
Calculates predicted scores by comparing team offense vs defense.

v2 improvements:
  - 3-way average formula (team offense, opp defense, league avg)
  - Regression to mean toward league average total
  - Optional Vegas total blending (70% model / 30% Vegas)
  - Hard clipping to sport-specific realistic bounds
  - All changes only affect predict_score(); all callers remain compatible
